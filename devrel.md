Example text for approaching a community:
Quick question. Gadfly.AI is running a friendly AI writing competition at Hackernoon.
Besides a nice monetary prize, the top authors will be interviewed by legendary Sal Kimmich (a really legendary person in the world of OpenSource, Security, AI).
I think this kind of publicity might be _very_ good for {community/company_name}.

Please drop me a message if you need any support for creating some cool posts.
